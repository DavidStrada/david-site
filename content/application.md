Hi Adam, my name is David

I wanted to reach out because I want the opportunity to add value to the team based on my skills and expertise. I am confident I meet your requirements and expectations.

While I don't call myself a designer, I've done it before back in the day when I started my career, used to sell themes on Themeforest / Design + Code has always been one of the things I enjoyed, I do it when I can, https://dribbble.com/davidstrada, https://themeforest.net/user/moosethemes/portfolio, I can definably work closely with you, help develope new ideas, brainstorming on hard problems, prototype rinse and repeat.

As a passionate, self-motivated software developer I would love to help plan new features using Laravel, Vue and other tools to get the job done, build products that other fellow developers enjoy using, help built products that they feel proud, help propel careers new endeavors.

I’m certain I can contribute with the team and I’d love the opportunity to work along with you guys (Adan, Steve). I can't wait to build new features for TailwindCSS.

Best Regards,

David


P.S. I started working on a tailwind builder, where you can built custom components, reuse the ones you already have on the site, use it as "legos" to build great UI/UX experiences.
