# Who Am I, What I do

I am a full-stack **PHP** developer. From a very early age I've been fascinated with computers, which led me to study Computer Science. Later, I fell in love with web development and never looked back.
Currently I'm working as a full-stack contract developer where I help different industries built internal/external apps and tools.

 I’ve always been an analytical person (think, then act). Taking things apart and putting them back together (sometimes in different ways to see what happens). That’s how I approach a challenge. I break it down as much as possible, analyze the pieces, and form a solution.

### My 2020 tech stack
- LARAVEL
- VUE.JS
- TAILWINDCSS
- AWS / DO / (Laravel Forge)
- Statamic, Craft (junior level).

### AGE
Old enough to enjoy a nice, cold cerveza 🍺.

### INTERESTS
1. 👨‍💻 Coding
2. 🏋️‍♂️ Lifting
3. 🚲 Cycling
4. 🚣🏾 Kayaking
5. 🕹 Gaming
